The quiz will be based on the following content
Diophantus, the “father of algebra,” is best known for his book Arithmetica, a work on the solution of algebraic equations and the theory of numbers. However, essentially nothing is known of his life, and there has been much debate regarding precisely the years in which he lived. Diophantus did his work in the great city of Alexandria. At this time, Alexandria was the center of mathematical learning. The period from 250 bce to 350 ce in Alexandria is known as the Silver Age, also the Later Alexandrian Age. This was a time when mathematicians were discovering many ideas that led to our current conception of mathematics. The era is considered silver because it came after the Golden Age, a time of great development in the field of mathematics. This Golden Age encompasses the lifetime of Euclid.
